# Submission Guidelines

The idea of using markdown within GitHub is to see who contributes to what work within the final group report.  It should be collaberative and make use of various tools to help with this.  Please use the file "Final Report Template" as a starting point for your report.

When finished you should export to PDF using VSCode and MarkdownPDF Extension.  Make sure you select no headers and no footers in the extension preferences before exporting to PDF.

Upload this PDF into Moodle - 1 per group.

Please delete this file before submission.
